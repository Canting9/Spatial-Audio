In the actual performance, due to some unexpected factors, we were unable to control the volume using the distance detected by the camera. Furthermore, although we originally planned to use three projectors, only two were used in the actual performance. However, due to changes in the venue, two projectors were sufficient to produce excellent visual effects. Regarding the camera, we found that the gesture recognition function completely failed in a completely dark environment, so we had to keep some lights on. Overall, despite various unexpected issues, the final presentation was satisfying to the audience.

Below are photos and videos taken at the actual show：
